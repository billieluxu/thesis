\chapter{Performance}
\label{ch:performance}

Performance of the Tendermint algorithm can be evaluated in a few key ways.
The most obvious measures are the block commit time, which is a measure of finalization latency, 
and transaction throughput, which measures the network's capacity.
We collect measurements for each on networks with validators distribtued over the globe, 
where the number of validators ranges, in multiples of 2, from 1 to 1024.

Experiments are also run for a select few applications on validator sets of size 4, 32, and 128.

\section{Transaction Throughput}

Plot transaction throughput vs number of validators, for a couple of apps, intra and inter datacenter

\section{Commit Times}

Plot block commit times vs number of validators, for different values of ProposeTimeout, intra and inter datacenter.


It may make sense to unify this chapter with the Fault Tolerance chapter.
