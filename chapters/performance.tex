\chapter{Performance}

Performance of the Tendermint algorithm can be evaluated in a few key ways.
The most obvious measures are the block commit time, which is a measure of finalization latency, 
and transaction throughput, which measures the network's capacity.

\section{Transaction Throughput}

Plot transaction throughput vs number of validators, for a couple of apps, intra and inter datacenter

\section{Commit Times}

Plot block commit times vs number of validators, for different values of ProposeTimeout, intra and inter datacenter.


It may make sense to unify this chapter with the Fault Tolerance chapter.
