\chapter{Theory}

\section{Consensus and Atomic Broadcast}
problem has been pitched as consensus or atomic broadcast
consensus commits a value; ABC orders transactions.
chandra & Toueg (1996) showed they're the same.
we show they are the same with generalized pi-calc forms of each and a bi-simualtion between them.
but atomic broadcast is the more natural form for real systems

\section{Cryptography vs. Entropy}
digital signatures.
merkle trees, erasure codes for broadcast.
hash-chain links to simplify proposer logic.

\section{Byzantine Failure Detectors}
chandra & toueg (1996) introduce failure detectors, an abstraction of timeouts,
used to solve consensus.
nestman 2003 formalizes in pi-calc, uses matrix analysis.
we introduce byzantine failure detectors, which track byz faults ...
1/3 affected by async, 1/3 byz, 1/3 honest and heard from (the table) ...
most previous byz algos dont focus on detection, just tolerance!

\section{Probabilistic Solutions}
consensus can be solved with FDs or with randomness.
common coin gives probabilistic liveness.
bitcoin gives probabilistic safety.
(asynchronous generalization of bitcoin is casper?)

\section{Economics}
economics are a way to parameterize the comm rates,
such that the param values may change, subject to some constraints 
(eg. the avg value over time is constant, etc.).
the point of the system is to be value, 
and have this value be contributed back to the processes as wealth.
integration with food systems, be an organism, etc.
economics makes the system reflexive.

\section{Residence Times}
energy input is receipt of a msg. 
causes a tree of execution. 
residence time is time until all branches of the tree either communicate with other trees or halt.
here, txs are the inputs (ie. they should pay fees!).
another energy input is eg. POW - can be measured as a packet of energy arriving as a new block
without inflation, packets arrive and are immediately released as heat, minus what is paid in fees,
which hang around as a balance and prolong the residence time.
the inflation increases the residence time, but is clearly unsustainable - distribution mechanisms are important tho!
alternatively, in POS, packets come in as security deposits, which sit around for a long time :D
