Byzantine consensus has a rich history that spans cryptography, distributed computing, and economics,
but the socio-economic context for its products to be deployed in industry has not existed until recently,
at least not outside of traditionally critical real-time systems like air-craft control \ref{draper_lab}.
On the one hand, the invention of Bitcoin and the coining of the term "blockchain" popularized the notion
of a distributed ledger not controlled by a single entity, using cryptography and aligned economic incentives to 
preserve safety in the face of Byzantine faults.
On the other, the continued commoditization of servers, in the form of "The Cloud", and the invention of Raft, 
have popularized distributed computing in mainstream developer culture, 
and brought renewed attention to distributed consensus algorithms as co-ordination hubs in large-scale deployments. 

At the intersection are a collection of solutions, typically geared for banking and financial applications,
but also for governance, logistics, and other general forms of co-ordination, 
that draw on classic academic BFT modified and modernized in various ways.
This chapter reviews the history and diversity of these ideas, with the goal of providing a rich context within which to 
understand the blockchain phenomenon.
