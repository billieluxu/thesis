\textbf{Tendermint Safety Guarantees}
\begin{description}
  \item[Proposer Safety] \hfill \\
	There is at most one valid proposer for every term.
  \item[Validator Append Only] \hfill \\
	A validator never overwrites or deletes blocks it has committed.
  \item[Proposer Completeness] \hfill \\
	If a block is committed at a given height, then that block will be present in the chain of all proposers at greater heights.
  \item[State Machine Safety] \hfill \\
	If a validator has applied a block at a given height to its state machine, no other validator will ever apply a different block for the same height.
