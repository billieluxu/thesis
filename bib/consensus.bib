		  	- delay(t) does not grow faster than t indefintely

		  Protocol:
		  	- "buffer requests and multicast as a group" as optimization -> ie. make blocks
			- 3 steps: pre-prepare, prepare, commit
			- "The pre-prepare and prepare phases are used to totally
			order  requests  sent  in  the  same  view  even  when  the
			primary,  which  proposes  the  ordering  of  requests,  is
			faulty. The prepare and commit phases are used to ensure
			that requests that commit are totally ordered across views"
			- request not included in the pre-prepare: " decouples the  protocol to  totally  order
			requests from the protocol to transmit the request to the
			replicas"
			- generate state proofs at checkpoints, say every 100 requests
			- garbage collect messages upto checkpoints
			- complicated view change semantics ...
			- "We also believe that it is possible to reduce the number of copies of the state to but the details remain to be worked out"
